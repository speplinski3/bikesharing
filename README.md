### Summary:
The NYC Citibike data provides us with some interesting insight for users of the service. Firstly, males are by far the most frequent users of the bike service. On average, a user will use a bike between 10-20 minutes, indicating that bikes are used for shorter periods of time. Females tend to use the bikes slighly longer than males. Weekend useage is distributed relately evenly during "business hours" (8 AM - 7 PM), while during the weekdays, useage is high on Thursday evenings from 5 PM - 7 PM. Subscribers are by far more common users when compared to single time customers. 

Potential future analysis could involve comparing use of public transportation by gender, time of year, or part of town in Des Moines vs. the NYC data. These are two very different cities with different demographics and city layouts. It might also be worth looking at how often Des Moines residents use subscription services for things such as ride-sharing to see if it would be worth presenting a bike-sharing subscription service.
